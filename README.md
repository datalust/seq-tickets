# Seq [![Read Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-online-blue.svg)](https://docs.datalust.co)

Welcome to the home of issues and discussions for [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq), the self-hosted search, analysis, and alerting server
built for structured logs and traces.

### Bugs

To report a **security-relevant bug**, please email `security@datalust.co` and do not raise an issue here. We diligently triage, fix, and disclose via CVE all vulnerabilities that are reported or internally discovered.

If you think you may have found a non-security relevant bug in Seq, this is the place to report it. You can **[search existing issues](https://github.com/datalust/seq-tickets/issues)** or **[raise a new issue](https://github.com/datalust/seq-tickets/issues/new)** here.

### Feature requests

Please also feel free to suggest features in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/datalust/seq-tickets/discussions). We will consider and respond to every request we receive.

### Documentation

The Seq [online documentation](http://docs.datalust.co) has information on all aspects of Seq - it's a great place to start if you are configuring or using Seq for the first time.

### Support

If you need more information or help with Seq, please feel free to post to our [discussion forum](https://github.com/datalust/seq-tickets/discussions), or email **support@datalust.co**.

### Feature roadmap

We maintain [feature milestones](https://github.com/datalust/seq-tickets/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open) for in-progress releases. A longer range roadmap is published to [`datalust.co/roadmap`](https://datalust.co/roadmap).


_To propose a feature, please [create a discussion thread](https://github.com/datalust/seq-tickets/discussions) to discuss it with the Seq development team. We will create RFCs and PRs where necessary._
